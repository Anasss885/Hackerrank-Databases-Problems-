Consider the following relation and determinants.

R(a, b,c,d)

                   a,c -> b,d
                   a,d -> b
        Also, a,b is a primary key for the above relation.
        
        
The above relation is in x NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.


THE ANSWER:
the ans is '3' as there's no multivalued , composite attributes ignore 1nf , and there's no Partial Dependency as the presence of prime att. with non prime one (AC) to 
determines another attributes is can be considered candidate key so ignore 2nf , going to 3nf there's no transtive Dependency but with BCNF it won't work
