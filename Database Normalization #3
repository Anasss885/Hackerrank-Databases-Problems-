A database used by a collegeâ€™s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. 
We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). 
In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. 
We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. From the above information,
what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?


THE ANSWER:the answe is ' 3 ' this type of Questions will have a several explanations from differnt perspectives so i highly recommend to read the many Explanations 
in the Discussion part in hackerrank , my explanation is a little bit simple as we know according to DB Design rule about establishing a many to many relation 
between 2 tables we must have a third table (i.e linkage table or intermediate table ) this way is not like establishing the relations one-to-one or one-to-many 
by putting the primary key of parent table to be a foreign key in the child table so by this way i reached to that the minimum number of tables we need is 3 , you can get
the same answer by another way , up to you
