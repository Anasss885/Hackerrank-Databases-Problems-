Consider the following relation and determinants. The key(s) are bolded.
R(a, b ,c,d,e) , the keys are a,b .

Which of these determinants is a NON-CANDIDATE key? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-3) of the dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1- a,c -> b,d,e
2- a,d -> b
3- a,c,e -> b,d


The Answer : ans is ' 2' 
as candidate key should define all the attributes of the relation.but  in second depandancy (a,d) is not defining all the attributes of the relation so it makes sense
